# Antigravity IDE Setup

Use the Hive agent framework (MCP servers and skills) inside [Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.google/) (Google’s AI IDE).

---

## Quick start (3 steps)

**Repo root** = the folder that contains `core/`, `tools/`, and `.antigravity/` (where you cloned the project).

1. **Open a terminal** and go to the hive repo root (e.g. `cd ~/hive`).
2. **Run the setup script** (use `./` so the script runs from this repo; don’t use `/scripts/...`):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-antigravity-mcp.sh
   ```
3. **Restart Antigravity IDE.** You should see **agent-builder** and **tools** as available MCP servers.

Done. For details, prerequisites, and troubleshooting, read on.

---

## What you get after setup

- **agent-builder** – Create and manage agents (goals, nodes, edges).
- **tools** – File operations, web search, and other agent tools.
- **Skills** – Guided docs for building and testing agents (in `.antigravity/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`).

---

## Prerequisites

- [Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.google/) installed.
- **Python 3.11+** and project dependencies. If you haven’t set up the repo yet, from repo root run:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/setup-python.sh
  ```
- **MCP server dependencies** (one-time). From repo root:
  ```bash
  cd core && ./setup_mcp.sh
  ```

---

## Full setup (step by step)

### Step 1: Install MCP dependencies (one-time)

From the **repo root**:

```bash
cd core
./setup_mcp.sh
```

This installs the framework and MCP packages and checks that the server can start.

### Step 2: Register MCP servers with Antigravity

Antigravity reads MCP config from your **user config file** (`~/.gemini/mcp.json`), not from the project. The easiest way is to run the setup script from the **hive repo folder**:

```bash
./scripts/setup-antigravity-mcp.sh
```

The script finds the repo root, writes `~/.gemini/mcp.json` with the right paths, and you don’t edit any paths by hand.

Then **restart Antigravity IDE**. The **agent-builder** and **tools** servers should show up.

**Using Claude Code instead?** Run:

```bash
./scripts/setup-antigravity-mcp.sh --claude
```

That writes `~/.claude/mcp.json` as well.

**Prefer to do it manually?** See [Manual MCP config](#manual-mcp-config-template) below. You’ll create `~/.gemini/mcp.json` (or `~/.claude/mcp.json`) with absolute paths to your repo’s `core` and `tools` folders.

### Step 3: Ignore the `cwd` warning (if you see it)

If the IDE says `cwd` is not allowed in the MCP config, you can **ignore it**. `cwd` is valid; the warning is from the schema and can be ignored.

### Step 4: Use skills

Skills are guides (workflow, building, testing) in `.antigravity/skills/` (they point to `.claude/skills/`). If Antigravity doesn’t show a “skills” UI, open those folders in the project and use the files as reference while you use the MCP tools.

| Skill | What it’s for |
|-------|----------------|
| **agent-workflow** | End-to-end workflow for building and testing agents |
| **building-agents-core** | Core ideas for goal-driven agents |
| **building-agents-construction** | Step-by-step agent construction |
| **building-agents-patterns** | Patterns and best practices |
| **testing-agent** | Goal-based evaluation and testing |

## What’s in the repo (`.antigravity/`)

```
.antigravity/
├── mcp_config.json   # Template for MCP servers (agent-builder, tools)
└── skills/           # Symlinks to .claude/skills/
```

The **setup script** writes your **user** config (`~/.gemini/mcp.json`) using paths from **this repo**. The file in `.antigravity/` is the template; Antigravity itself uses the file in your home directory.

---

## Troubleshooting

**MCP servers don’t connect**

- Run the setup script again from the hive repo root: `./scripts/setup-antigravity-mcp.sh`, then restart Antigravity.
- Make sure Python and deps are installed: from repo root run `./scripts/setup-python.sh`.
- Check that the servers can start: from repo root run  
  `cd core && python3 -m framework.mcp.agent_builder_server` (Ctrl+C to stop), and in another terminal  
  `cd tools && PYTHONPATH=src python3 mcp_server.py --stdio` (Ctrl+C to stop).  
  If those fail, fix the errors first (e.g. install deps).

**“Module not found” or import errors**

- Open the **repo root** as the project in the IDE (the folder that has `core/` and `tools/`).
- If you edited `~/.gemini/mcp.json` by hand, make sure `cwd` is the **absolute** path to `core` and `tools` (e.g. `/Users/you/hive/core` and `/Users/you/hive/tools`).

**Skills don’t show up in the UI**

- Antigravity may not have a dedicated “skills” panel. Use the files in `.claude/skills/` or `.antigravity/skills/` as docs; the MCP tools (agent-builder, tools) still work.

---

## Verification prompt (optional)

Paste this into Antigravity to check that MCP and skills are set up. It doesn’t use your machine’s paths; anyone can use it.

```
Check the Hive + Antigravity integration:

1. MCP: List available MCP servers/tools. Confirm that "agent-builder" and "tools" (or equivalent) are connected. If not, tell the user to run ./scripts/setup-antigravity-mcp.sh from the hive repo root, then restart Antigravity (see docs/antigravity-setup.md).

2. Skills: Confirm that the project has .antigravity/skills/ (or .claude/skills/) with: agent-workflow, building-agents-core, building-agents-construction, building-agents-patterns, testing-agent.

3. Result: Reply with PASS (MCP + skills OK), PARTIAL (only skills or only MCP), or FAIL (neither), and one line on what to fix if not PASS.
```

If you get **PARTIAL** (e.g. MCP not connected), run `./scripts/setup-antigravity-mcp.sh` from the repo root and restart Antigravity.

## Manual MCP config template

Use this only if you don’t want to run the setup script. Replace `/path/to/hive` with your actual repo root (e.g. the output of `pwd` when you’re in the hive folder).

Save as `~/.gemini/mcp.json` (Antigravity) or `~/.claude/mcp.json` (Claude Code), then restart the IDE.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-builder": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "framework.mcp.agent_builder_server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/hive/core",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "../tools/src"
      }
    },
    "tools": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py", "--stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/hive/tools",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use `python` instead of `python3` if that’s what you have.

---

## Verify from the command line (optional)

From the **repo root**:

**Check that config and skills exist**

```bash
test -f .antigravity/mcp_config.json && echo "OK: mcp_config.json" || echo "MISSING"
for s in agent-workflow building-agents-core building-agents-construction building-agents-patterns testing-agent; do
  test -L .antigravity/skills/$s && test -d .antigravity/skills/$s && echo "OK: $s" || echo "BROKEN: $s"
done
```

**Check that the config is valid JSON**

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('.antigravity/mcp_config.json')); print('OK: valid JSON')"
```

**Test that MCP servers start** (two terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd core && PYTHONPATH=../tools/src python3 -m framework.mcp.agent_builder_server

# Terminal 2
cd tools && PYTHONPATH=src python3 mcp_server.py --stdio
```

If both start without errors, the config is fine.
